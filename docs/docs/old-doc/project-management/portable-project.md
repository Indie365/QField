title: Portable Project
---

You will need a portable version of your QGIS project file (.qgs).
Portable means that all paths are relative and datasets are reachable
from the device.

Check that
`Project --> Project Properties --> General --> Save paths`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} is set to \"Relative\" and that all required data
files are in the same folder like the .qgs file or a subfolder of it.

For increased productivity, we suggest having a look at the [QFieldSync
plugin](https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/qfieldsync).

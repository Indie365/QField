of the map.

Identify features
=================

Tap on a feature on the map to identify it. If several features are
located on the point you tapped (either because there are multiple
features really close one to another, or because several layers are
overlapping), they will all be listed in the menu that opens on the
right of the screen.

Tap on one of the listed feature to access its attributes.

1.  Tap the **arrows** to scroll through all the identified features.
2.  Tap the **centre button** to center the map on the selected feature.
3.  Tap the **edit button** to edit the attributes of the selected
    feature.
4.  Scrool through the **sub-menus** to access all the attributes.

Exceptions to identified layers
-------------------------------

Often it is not required to be able to query every layer. Some layers
are only present as basemap and their attributes are not of interest.

You can manage this layerlist in QGIS desktop in
`Project --> Project Properties --> Identify Layers`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and uncheck the base layers.

Searching
=========

Tap on the **Search button** on the top-right corner to search in the
layers.

1.  Tap on the **name** in the result to pan the map on the feature (the
    feature will be highlighted in yellow).
2.  Tap on the **attributes button** to open its attributes.

Switching Map Theme
===================

If you defined map themes for your project in QGIS, you can switch
between them using the first drop-down in the **Main menu**.

GPS
===

A short press on the GPS button will turn on the GPS and center to the
current location once positioning information is available.

A long press on the GPS button will show the positioning menu.

Inside the positioning menu you can turn on the positioning display
which will show the current coordinates which are reprojected into the
project CRS along with precision information.

Note
:::

If you see WGS 84 lat/lon information instead of information in your
project CRS, you probably have no signal yet.

Using external GNSS-Reciever
----------------------------

It is possible to provide a mock location a separate android app to
qfield. There are several options for this, one of them is [Android
NTRIP
Client](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lefebure.ntripclient).

To use this you have to [enable mock locations on your Android
device](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1eRHmMiRJQ).

Digitizing
==========

To start digitizing new features, enable the **Edit mode** in the main
menu (*pencil button*) and select the layer on which you want to add a
new feature (the layer will be highlighted in grey).

Points
------

Navigate the crosshair in the center of the screen to the desired
location and click the **+ button** at the lower right of the screen to
confirm the creation of a new point feature.

You can use the **keep centered** button to force the crosshair to
center on your location if you have enabled the GPS.

Lines and polygons
------------------

Navigate the crosshair in the center of the screen to the desired start
of the line or polygon and click the **Plus (+) button** at the lower
right of the screen to add the first node.

Proceed with adding points to form you line or polygon by clicking the
**Plus (+) button** each time you want to add a new node.

Click the **Minus (-) button** to remove the last added node.

Click the **Close (X) button** to cancel the feature creation
completely.

When you have added a least 2 nodes for a line or 3 nodes for a polygon,
a **Save button** will appear. Click on it to finish your sketch.

Attribute form
--------------

After digitizing a geometry, the attribute form will be displayed if it
is not suppressed and the user will be asked to enter the attributes for
the new feature. The form which appears allows entering attribute values
for the new feature. The checkboxes at the right of every attribute
allow for remembering each attribute individually. The next time you
will add a feature on the same layer, these attributes will be already
pre-filled.

Deleting features is only possible in digitize mode.

To delete a feature, identify it first and tap the trash icon.

Edit the geometry of an existing feature
========================================

To complete.

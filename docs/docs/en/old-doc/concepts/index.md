title: Concepts

QField was designed with a few key concepts in mind.

Keep it simple
==============

The requirements on the field are not the same as on a desktop. The
screen is smaller, the input devices are different and the tasks are
different.

QField aims to help the user to perform the tasks he needs to do without
cluttering the user interface. This means, that only tasks which need to
be done on the field are availble from the interface. Everything else is
not.

This means that everything like layer styling, form definitions and
other project setup steps should be done on a computer with QGIS
installed first.

Be compatible with QGIS
=======================

QField is based on QGIS. It is not a rebuild of QGIS it really *does*
use QGIS libraries. The rendering engine is exactly the same as in QGIS
for desktop and your project will therefore look exactly the same on
your mobile device as it does on your computer.

If something is already available as a configuration option in a QGIS
project, it should not be re-invented. QField therefore uses the same
edit widgets as QGIS desktop does. If a project is already configured
for the desktop, it should just run on mobile as well.

Remember, this is just the *concept*. This is what we have in mind when
we develop QField. It does not mean that it is already completely there
yet.

Mode based
==========

QField is built around *modes*. Modes are similar to a *map tool* in
QGIS desktop. A mode defines the task which a user is currently doing.
Either a user is *browsing* through the data or he is *digitizing*
something new.

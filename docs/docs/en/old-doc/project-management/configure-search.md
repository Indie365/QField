title: Search in layers
---

You can search for features in vector layers. The search is currently
performing the same as the *all layers locator filter* in QGIS
(accessible in QGIS locator bar using *af* prefix).

Configure search in QGIS
========================

1.  Choose the layers which are searchable in
    `Project --> Project Properties --> Identify Layers`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"}
2.  Define the *display expression* for the concerned layers, this will
    be used for searching for features. This is configured under
    `Vector Layer Properties --> Display`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"} page

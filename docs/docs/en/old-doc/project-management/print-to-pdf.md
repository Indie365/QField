title: Print to PDF
---

It\'s possible to export the maps and other items to a PDF document.

If the project has at least one print layout defined, they are available
over the menu.

::: {.container .clearer .text-center}
![](../images/print_menu.jpg){width="500px"}
:::

After selecting the print layout, the PDF document is created and stored
in the devices documents directory.

By choosing the PDF reader app, the document can be opened directly.

::: {.container .clearer .text-center}
![](../images/print_open.jpg){width="500px"}
:::

Done.

::: {.container .clearer .text-center}
![](../images/print_document.jpg){width="500px"}
:::

::: {.note}
::: {.title}
Note
:::

The devices documents directory is `USER>/<APPNAME>/Documents`. For
`QField` this is usually a path like
`////storage/emulated/0/Documents/QField`
